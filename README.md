### What I learned

How to configure tailwind plugins, prettier + eslint: 

1. Install following packages 
```bash
  npm i prettier eslint-config-prettier prettier-plugin-tailwind
```
2. Create "prettier.config.js" in the root of your app and paste following snippet:
```js
  module.exports = {
    plugins: ['prettier-plugin-tailwindcss']
  }
```
3. Ensure that you have extensions installed – „Tailwind CSS IntelliSense”, „Prettier – Code formatter” and „ESlint”.

4. Open settings => Files:Associations and ensure you have item: "*.css" with value: "tailwindcss".

5. Open settings => Editor: Quick Suggestions and ensure you have "other" on, "comments" off and "strings" on.

6. Select Prettier as default formatter in settings => Default Formatter.

7. Create file ".eslintrc.json" in the root of your app and paste following snippet:
```json
  {
    "extends": ["next/core-web-vitals", "prettier"]
  }
```
